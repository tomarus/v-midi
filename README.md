FPGA/Verilog MIDI Mixer
=======================

This is my Verilog/FPGA learning project and playground.

This uses a Basys 3 development board. Designed and build in Vivado. It needs custom MIDI circuits connected to the PMOD ports.

Eventually this should be a 16 port MIDI switch and router.

it handles sysex to configure itself, and it does already route some messages.

It needs my MidiSeq for configuration: https://github.com/tomarus/midiseq
